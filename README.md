## General Information

There are Two types of risks associated with the bank’s decision :

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

Two scenarios associated with this decision:

#### Loan accepted: 
   If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

   - Fully paid   : Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
   - Current      : Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed and are not labelled as 'defaulted’.
   - Charged-off  : Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan.
   
#### Loan rejected: 
   If company not approved the loan because of not meeting the requirement's of the bank rules.
